This directory was created on 10.30.18 for me to learn how to use github and git.

I am using this video for guidance:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xePqfHP7k8


There is a github repository that goes along with the video to be found here:
https://github.com/mjhea0/thinkful-mentor/blob/master/git-workflow.md

If changes made remotely, then this worked (but need to be careful) to bring back in to local:
git pull https://github.com/saeedahmed12/TestingGit.git
