This director was created on 10.30.18 for me to learn how to use github and git.

I am using this video for guidance:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xePqfHP7k8


There is a github repository that goes along with the video to be found here:

Starting a new project
Create project directory on local machine
In terminal, navigate to newly created directory
Create a new git repo: git init
Add a readme.md file that states what the project is all about: touch readme.md
Add a .gitignore file: touch .gitignore
Add files to staging: git add -A (taking a snapshot)
Add files (snapshot) to local repo: git commit -m "commit message"
Go to Github and add a new repository
After you create repo, copy the "remote add" line, then paste back within your project directory in your terminal
Now push your local repo to Github: git push origin master


Updating an existing project
After you make your updates, add files to staging git add -A (taking a snapshot)
Add files (snapshot) to local repo: git commit -m "commit message"
Now push your local repo to Github: git push origin master
